Extensions for Houdini Engine for Unity

Added support for unity 2d tilemaps as input for Houdini Engine. 
Tilemap is converted to point grid with all important attributes as point attributes or detail attributes (sprite name, size, tile coordinates, color, tilemap dimensions etc.)

You can use this to generate procedural meshes based on tilemap layouts, scatter object instances or other cool stuff.
